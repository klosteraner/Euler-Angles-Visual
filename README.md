# Euler angle visualization

The app aims at visualizing Euler angles, or more correctly speaking Tait-Bryan angles.
While I found the general principle of Euler / Tait-Bryan angles can be understood 
from theory, I found it hard to visualize the concrete definitions. 

This app helped me getting a better intuition about the world axes & camera axes definitions
as well as how the rotation order influences the final rotation.

TODOs:

- Better documentation
  - in particular how it helped me discovering aspects of mayavi
  - what aspects can be explored
  - possibly explanation visual system <-> world system <-> camera system
  - possibly some theory  
- clear instructions for install / execution (currently it works on my machine)
- text3d seems to have some trouble and throws warnings -> investigate
- Can it be embedded on webpage? Else screenshot + Link
- Make switch between different systems available in UI
- Split view to compare different combinations
